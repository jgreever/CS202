 * This is the node class header file. It contains the node class and the needed
 * functions for it to work. This is NOT a struct, but an actual class instead.
 * Since we are working with OOP, using a struct would break that concept. This
 * node class will be used in the BST class. The BST class will hold the *root
 * pointer, and the node class will node the *left and *right pointers.
 *
 * I am currently debating the idea of making the node class a derived class
 * of the bst class, but I'm not sure if this is even needed.
