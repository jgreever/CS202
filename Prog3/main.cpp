 * CS202 - Program 3
 * 2/18/2021
 *
 * This program is designed to teach us about operator overloading
 * and inheritance better than we already should.
 *
 * This program will have us create a "contact list" that holds info
 * about a contact and three methods of contact (two paid, one must
 * be a text based option) for each contact. In this case, mine will
 * be a cellphone, a pager (who uses these even?! xD) and a VoIP type
 * service, similar to Skype Premium.
 *
 * Operator Overloading Requirements (as per the CS202 Program 3.pdf):
 * "The operators to support must include: =, +, +=, [], ==, !=,
 *  the relational/equality operators, and the ability to input/output
 *  data."
 *
 * "In Program #3, you CAN now write your own STRING data type, but it
 *  canâ€™t be the only place you use operator overloading (since it is
 *  provided in topic #6!)"
 *
 * The Data Structure I will be using will be a BST and a LLL. Both of
 * these will be implemented as classes, no structs, to keep it OOP.
 *
