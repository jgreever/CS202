 * 
 * Program 3, or Let's Overload those operators and Inherit
 * our Base class!
 * 
 * The main purpose of this program is to experience operator
 * overloading and continue with Inheritance.
 * 
 * As per Program 3 instructions:
 * Apply Operator Overloading to these classes: An important
 * part of this assignment is to implement a complete set of
 * operators. The operators to support must include: =, +, +=,
 * [], ==, !=, the relational/equality operators, and the ability
 * to input/output data. You may apply these to a single class
 * or use them throughout your hierarchy.
 * 
 * Using https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators
 * as a reference for Operator Overloading.
 * 
 * Overloads planned (+/- a few more later):
 *   bool &operator==(const T&);
 *   bool &operator!=(const T&);
 *   bool &operator<(const T&);
 *   bool &operator>(const T&);
 *   T& operator+(const T&, const T&);
 *   T& operator[](const T&) const;
 *   T& operator=(const T&);
 *   T& operator+=(const T&);
