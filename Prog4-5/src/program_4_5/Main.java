/*
 * Justin Greever
 * CS202 - Program 4
 * 3/5/2021
 *
 * Program 4 is designed to continue our knowledge of dynamic binding/upcasting,
 * Inheritance, and 'overloading' of functions, since Java doesn't have operator
 * overloading.
 *
 * The main requirements for Program 4 are:
 *      Your own implementation of an ARR for one of the derived classes
 *      Function overloading for basic operators
 *      One main base class with 2 derived classes that each have 3 derived classes
 * This program will continue into Program 5, so some code will change, but for the
 * most part, everything is looking good.
