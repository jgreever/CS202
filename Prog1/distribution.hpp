 * This is our distribution class file. It will manage how the  item that
 * the user purchased gets to them. This allows us to determine if the item
 * will be shipped via ground or air, and if it will be sent overnight,
 * standard, or express based on the item location (which warehouse its at).
 * We have an option to hold a package in this class, in the event the user
 * decides they don't want the item, or need to pick it up at a local place
 * or new address.
