 * 
 * The purpose of this program is to make a logistics system that goes from
 * Order -> Warehouse -> Distribution Center -> Package -> Transportation
 * 
 * The program is using multiple classes that have some using Inheritance 
 * in order to use the public functions from the Base class in the Derrived
 * class. This is to help understand OOP. The ADT's may not be fully OOP, 
 * as Karla stated in class, but I am doing my best to research and make them
 * fully OOP, or as fully as I am able to.
 * 
 * This file is just the basic interface for testing the application. Any items
 * that are required (inventory categories, tracking numbers, inventory count)
 * will be automatically generated and added to the proper ADT at runtime.
